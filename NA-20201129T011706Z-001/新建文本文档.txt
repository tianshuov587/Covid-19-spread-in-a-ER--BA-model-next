In our project, we created the BA ，ER network，and a network with community structure. Then we  explored
 how the virus spread in the different network under different government policies。

On the left is a graph of the number of  COVID-19 case  from CDC and
the graph on the right shows Three waves of death in England during
 the Spanish pandemic.Our goal is to find out what factors are 
affecting the spread of the virus among the population and what 
causes the second outbreak. Therefore, in this project, 
we focus on observing the role of policies and immunity


Each of the three main functions will be performed on each of
 our simulated days.

it represents the relationship between two points

Policy will decrease all the edges' weight, which simulates goverment ask people to stay at home.
In our project, it is a changed varaiable, it becomes more strict as more nodes are infected
If a node is quarantine at home , we would decrease most of its Edges' weight , except for the weight, which is more than 0.8.
We wanted to show that his family was inevitably at risk of infection when he was quarantine at home
If a node is in hospital, we will decresse all its edge's weight to zero
And then we will let Virus spreads and update each nodes' state 

First of all, we will determine whether the node is infected or not. If this node is infected, it will have the possibility of P1 being asymptomatic, and the possibility of 1-P1 being symptomatic.Then for a point that is already asymptomatic, it stays there for d1 days, during which time it will be infectious and not subject to any other factors, after d1 days, it will have a p2 probability of starting to show symptoms, and again, 1-p2 probability will heal naturally

For symptomatic nodes, it stays there for a few days and then goes into home quarantine. During the state transition, we decrease its  Edges' Weight.For those who have been quarantined at home, they will either recover after a few days or get worse and enter the hospital.

as for the node in hospital, it only has two choice , recover or dead

In addition, once Node recovers, we give it a immunity time so that it won't get sick again
