# Covid-19-spread-in-a-ER--BA-model-next
As of 3 December 2020, covid-19 has spread to more than 218 Countries and Territories and caused more than 1.5 million deaths. The government made a series of policies to control the spread of the epidemic, such as asking people to keep the social distance and wear masks, close restaurants and so on. Partly because of these policies, medical resources have not been overstretched. Hence, we simulated the impact of medical resources on mortality. Also, when the epidemic improves, the policy will be less forceful, which could lead to a second outbreak. Therefore, in our network, we set the policy intensity as a negative correlation function of the epidemic degree. Observe a model of epidemic transmission under these conditions. At the same time, under the home quarantine policy, people's relationship network becomes more similar to the community structure. We also hope to find out how effective the home quarantine policy is.
